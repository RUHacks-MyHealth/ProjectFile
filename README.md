We built a progressive health care web application using Glitch, with the objective of providing an online platform on which physicians and patients can directly interact with each other. Our web app contains APIs such as calender and google map APIs, as well as QR codes built using echoAR. Our web app includes features such as live global Covid-19 cases and a chat box between doctors and patients.


The reason why we used the website Glitch to create a web app is that it provided us with the opportunity to work on the code simultaneously. It was a great platform to interact and learn with each other despite the long distance between the members.
